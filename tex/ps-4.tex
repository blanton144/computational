\title{\bf Computational Physics / PHYS-UA 210 / Problem Set \#4
\\ Due October 6, 2017 }

Submit this homework to the TA as a link to the Jupyter Notebook
and/or a PDF file, checked into your GitHub account, in the place
specified in the class notes for Lecture \#1.

You {\it must} label all axes of all plots, including giving the {\it
  units}!!

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exercise 1 in S5.5 of Landau.

  \item Exercise 5.12.3 in Landau. Note in Equation (70) this $N$ is
    not the same $N$ as in the rest of the problem, which is the
    number of integration points. For the table of errors as a
    function of $N$, just use odd numbers, I don't know why they list
    even numbers when they are asking you to use Simpson's Rule. You
    may use the SciPy routines for Gaussian quadrature weights to
    calculate them.

  \item Derive the weighting in Equation 5.61 in Landau, submitting
    the derivation as a PDF made using Latex.

\end{enumerate}
