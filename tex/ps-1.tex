\\ Due September 15, 2017 }

Submit this homework to the TA as a link to the Jupyter Notebook
checked into your GitHub account, in the place specified in the class
notes for Lecture \#1.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Familiarize yourself enough with a plotting package in Python
    (e.g. {\tt matplotlib}) to plot a Gaussian with zero mean and a
    standard deviation of 3 over the range [$-$10, $+$10]. Make sure
    the Gaussian is normalized correctly.

  \item Exercise (2) in S2.4.3 of Landau.

  \item Perform the exercises described in S2.5.2 of Landau.
