    title = {The Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey},
 abstract = {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this data release, the imaging of the northern Galactic cap is now complete. The survey contains images and parameters of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2, including scans over a large range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The survey also includes 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars, and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg2 . This release includes much more stellar spectroscopy than was available in previous data releases and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures, gravities, and metallicities. The results of improved photometric calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1% in g, r, i, and z, and 2% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties in previous data releases. The spectra in this data release have improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination of stellar types and radial velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes are now tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars rather than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust results in the presence of seeing variations, but also implies a change in the spectrophotometric scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35 mag. Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications and redshifts are made available. Additional spectral outputs are made available, including calibrated spectra from individual 15 minute exposures and the sky spectrum subtracted from each exposure. We also quantify a recently recognized underestimation of the brightnesses of galaxies of large angular extent due to poor sky subtraction; the bias can exceed 0.2 mag for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

abstract = {It is pointed out that the outer parts of galaxies often exhibit distinct surface brightness enhancements. The development of rings and shells around galaxies has been ascribed to mechanisms in which the interaction of a galaxy with its neighbors plays a key role. According to some concepts, the big events, such as those leading to the formation of ring galaxies, are interspersed with an entire set of smaller ones. In particular, small galaxies in a group are inclined to fall into their bigger neighbors without affecting the latter very much. After the event, the big galaxy is provided with certain features, taking into account ellipticals with shells, and S0s with polar rings. A review is conducted of the properties of these types of galaxies, insofar as their outskirts have identifiable shells or rings. Attention is given to ring galaxies, outer rings around spirals and S0s, polar ring galaxies, and shells around elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {We suggest that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature correlation function C(θ) as a function of angle provides a direct connection between experimental data and the fundamental cosmological quantities. The evolution of inhomogeneities in the prerecombination universe is studied using Green's functions in position space. We find that a primordial adiabatic point perturbation propagates as a sharp-edged spherical acoustic wave. Density singularities at its wave fronts create a feature in the CMB correlation function distinguished by a dip at θ~1.2$\,^{\circ}$. Characteristics of the feature are sensitive to the values of cosmological parameters, in particular to the total and the baryon densities.},

title = {AGN-controlled cooling in elliptical galaxies},
abstract = {A long-standing problem for models of galaxy formation has been the mismatch between the predicted shape of the mass function of dark matter halos and the observed shape of the luminosity function of galaxies. The number of massive haloes is predicted to decrease as a power law (N~M-2) out to very large masses, while the galaxy luminosity function cuts off exponentially at luminosities above L*. This implies that the efficiency with which gas cools onto massive systems is lower than expected. This letter investigates the role of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in continually re-heating the cooling gas. By combining two observational results, the time-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity is determined, as a function of the black hole mass of the host galaxy: . It is shown that for massive elliptical galaxies this radio-source heating balances the radiative energy losses from the hot gas surrounding the galaxy. The recurrent radio-loud AGN activity may therefore provide a self-regulating feedback mechanism capable of controlling the rate of growth of galaxies.},

title = {The Star Formation Law in Nearby Galaxies on Sub-Kpc Scales},
abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between star formation rate surface density, ΣSFR, and gas surface density, Σgas, at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18 nearby galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies, 24 μm data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 relates ΣSFR and ΣH2 across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is ~2 × 109 years. The range of ΣH2 over which we measure this relation is ~3-50 M sun pc 2, significantly lower than in starburst environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with approximately uniform properties and that ΣH2 may be more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total gas surface density (Σgas) and ΣSFR varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between ΣHI and ΣSFR. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE), ΣSFR/Σgas, varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is systematic and consistent with the SFE being set by local environmental factors: in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the SFE. In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at ΣHI ≈ 9 M sun pc 2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

abstract = {For a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated the radial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induced UV light attenuation. To do this we have cross-correlated IRAS images and GALEX observations for each of these galaxies and compiled observations of the gas (CO and H I) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. We find that attenuation correlates with metallicity. We then use the UV profiles, corrected for attenuation, to study several variants of the Schmidt law and conclude that our results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of Kennicutt extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerable scatter. We do not detect an abrupt break in the UV light at the threshold radius derived from Hα data (at which the Hα profile shows a break and beyond which only a few H II regions are usually found). We interpret the Hα sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as often suggested), but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars corresponding to low levels of star formation.},

abstract = {We present maps of the ^12^CO (J=1-0) and (J=2-1) lines in three peculiar galaxies in the Abell 1367 cluster: CGCG 97073, 97079 and 97087. These three galaxies are known to show marked asymmetries in their atomic gas and star-forming regions distribution as well as in their radio continuum emission. The CO observations were aimed at finding asymmetries in the CO distribution that would be the signature of tidal interactions, either between the galaxies or with the cluster as a whole. However, we have found that the molecular gas distribution does not exhibit any strong asymmetries, and that the molecular gas content of the three galaxies is normal. This, and the fact that asymmetries are not seen in the old stellar distribution, does not however rule out the tidal hypothesis since mild interactions could remove the external atomic gas without disturbing the molecular gas and old stars. The alternative explanation is the ram-pressure exerted by the hot intergalactic gas, which would explain not only the peculiar atomic gas and star formation distributions, but also the orientation of the radio continuum tails and the location of the HII regions.},

title = {The Physics of Cosmic Acceleration},
abstract = {The discovery that the cosmic expansion is accelerating has been followed by an intense theoretical and experimental response in physics and astronomy. The discovery implies that our most basic notions about how gravity work are violated on cosmological distance scales. One simple fix is the introduction of a cosmological constant into the field equations for general relativity. However, the extremely small value of the cosmological constant, relative to theoretical expectations, has led theorists to explore a wide variety of alternative explanations that involve the introduction of an exotic negative-pressure fluid or a modification of general relativity. Here we briefly review the evidence for cosmic acceleration. We then survey some of the theoretical attempts to account for it, including the cosmological constant, quintessence and its variants, mass-varying neutrinos, and modifications of general relativity, such as scalar-tensor and {\$}f(R){\$} theories and braneworld scenarios. We discuss experimental and observational tests that may allow us to distinguish between some of the theoretical ideas that have been put forward.},

title = {Molecular gas in spiral galaxies},
abstract = {The molecular hydrogen content of a galaxy is a key parameter for its activity and future evolution. Its variations with basic properties such as size, mass, morphological type, and environment, the ratio of molecular to atomic gas masses, should provide us with a better view of galaxy evolution. Such studies have been done in the past by Sage (1993a) or the FCRAO group (e.g. Young {\&} Knezek 1989), and have led to controversial results, for example about the MHH /MHI ratio. While Sage (1993a), using a distance-limited sample of 65 galaxies and the \COA line emission as a tracer of the HH mass, finds that most galaxies have MHH /MHI lower than 1, Young {\&} Knezek (1989) and Young et al. (1995), from a different sample of 178 objects, claim equal amounts of gas in the molecular and atomic phase. Here we again tackle this problem, by gathering a much larger sample of 582 objects, not only from the literature but also from several \COA surveys that we have completed and which are largely unpublished. Our sample is clearly not complete and contains a large number of cluster galaxies as well as many more massive objects than a distance-limited sample. Contrary to previous analyses, we have taken into account the non-detections by using the survival analysis method. Our sample includes 105 isolated galaxies, observed by us, that we use as a reference sample in order to determine whether cluster galaxies are CO-deficient. We find that the ratio of HH and HI masses is on the average lower than 1, with <log(MHH /MHI )> = log(0.20) +/- 0.04 (median = log(0.27) +/- 0.04). For spirals with types Sa to Sc, we have slightly higher values: log(0.28) and log(0.34) respectively. The actual HH masses and MHH /MHI ratios could be lower than given above if, as suggested by recent gamma -ray and 1.3 mm continuum data, the conversion factor between \COA emissivities and HH masses for large spiral galaxies is lower than the value adopted here (X=2.310(20) cm(-2) /(Kkms(-1) )). The molecular to atomic gas ratio shows a constant value from Sa to Sbc's, and a factor of 10 decrease for late-types, beginning at Sc's. This effect can be attributed to the low CO emission of late-type, low-mass galaxies; we find no such decrease for objects with a dynamical mass larger than 10(11) Mo . These high-mass objects actually show an increase of their normalized atomic and molecular gas content towards late-types, while for low-mass objects, this is seen on HI only. Several authors have tried to search for galaxies deficient in HH in the core of clusters such as Virgo or Coma, but these studies were hampered by the lack of a suitable reference sample (Kenney {\&} Young 1989, Casoli et al. 1991, Horellou et al. 1995b). Using isolated galaxies and galaxies in the outer regions of clusters as a reference sample, we give a predictor for the normalized HH mass of a galaxy Mi /D25 (2) , which depends upon its normalized far-infrared emission LFIR /D25 (2) and its morphological type. This predictor allows us to define a ``CO deficiency factor'', CODEF, analogous to what has been defined for the HI emission. We find that there is no significant CO deficiency of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters.},

title = {Virgo Galaxies with Long One-sided H I Tails},
abstract = {In a new H I imaging survey of Virgo galaxies (VIVA: VLA Imaging of Virgo galaxies in Atomic gas), we find seven spiral galaxies with long H I tails. The morphology varies, but all the tails are extended well beyond the optical radii on one side. These galaxies are found in intermediate- to low-density regions (0.6-1 Mpc in projection from M87). The tails are all pointing roughly away from M87, suggesting that these tails may have been created by a global cluster mechanism. While the tidal effects of the cluster potential are too small, a rough estimate suggests that simple ram pressure stripping could have indeed formed the tails in all but two cases. At least three systems show H I truncation to within the stellar disk, providing evidence of a gas-gas interaction. Although most of these galaxies do not appear disturbed optically, some have close neighbors, suggesting that tidal interactions may have moved gas outward, making it more susceptible to the intracluster medium ram pressure or viscosity. Indeed, a simulation study of one of the tail galaxies, NGC 4654, suggests that the galaxy is most likely affected by the combined effect of a gravitational interaction and ram pressure stripping. We conclude that these one-sided H I tail galaxies have recently arrived in the cluster, falling in on highly radial orbits. It appears that galaxies begin to lose their gas already at intermediate distances from the cluster center through ram pressure or turbulent viscous stripping and tidal interactions with their neighbors, or a combination of both.},

abstract = {Long time-scale three-dimensional N-body simulations of galaxies composed of two components, a self-consistent disk and a spheroidal halo, demonstrate that bars develop over a large range of halo mass to disk mass ratios. Such nonaxisymmetric systems dynamically evolve at a rate which depends upon this ratio. For systems with low mass halos (the ratio being less than or equal to 1), strong bars quickly form but then weaken to a quasi steady state in less than twenty rotation times. For systems with high halo mass, the bar strength is still increasing after 20 rotation times. This suggests that the strong bars observed in SBb galaxies have not persisted since the epoch of galaxy formation but have developed more recently in systems with the ratio being greater than or equal to 2.},

title = {The dynamics and structure of the cD galaxy in Abell 2029},
abstract = {Spectra of the envelope of the cD galaxy in the rich cluster of galaxies Abell 2029 out to over 100 kpc are analyzed by using a Fourier cross-correlation technique. It is found that the measured velocity dispersion apparently increases with radius, implying that the M/L ratio of the envelope is increasing rapidly. All that is presently known about the cluster and the cD galaxy is accounted for by a three-component King (1966) model consisting of a 'normal elliptical' galaxy, a high-M/L cluster-filling and cluster-binding superstructure, and a component of intermediate M/L and velocity dispersion that supplies the light of the 'extended halo'. The high-M/L component is tentatively identified with stripped dark halos of cluster galaxies, and the intermediate-M/L material is attributed to the dynamical friction process that disrupts massive luminous galaxies as they encounter the cD envelope.},

title = {Improving Cosmological Distance Measurements by Reconstruction of the Baryon Acoustic Peak},
abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the nonlinear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the nonlinearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

This spiral arm classification system was previously shown to correlate with the presence of density waves, and galaxies with such waves were shown to occur primarily in the densest galactic groups. The present sample indicates, in addition, that grand design galaxies (i.e., those which tend to contain prominent density wave modes) are physically larger than flocculent galaxies (which do not contain such prominent modes) by a factor of about 1.5. A larger group sample confirms the previous result that grand design galaxies are preferentially in dense groups.},

title = {Global scaling relations for elliptical galaxies and implications for formation},
abstract = {Two recent surveys of elliptical galaxy structural properties are described. E galaxies are seen to populate a planar distribution in the global logarithmic parameter space (Re,σe,Ie). Two-dimensionality implies that the virial theorem is the only tight constraint on E structure. There is an additional, weaker constraint on radius versus mass that was presumably imposed at formation. The best-fitting plane in logarithmic coordinates has the equation Re ≡ σ1.35$\pm$0.07Ie-0.84$\pm$0.03, which implies (M/L)e ≡ L0.24$\pm$0.04Ie0.00$\pm$0.06. The planar relation can be used to determine distances to E galaxies to an accuracy of $\pm$23%. An analogous, parallel plane exists for core properties. Core and gobal M/Ls argree well, implying that ellipticals are mainly baryon dominated within Re and that M/Ls are stellar.

title = {Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe},
abstract = {Ten years ago, the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating put in place the last major building block of the present cosmological model, in which the universe is composed of 4% baryons, 20% dark matter, and 76% dark energy. At the same time, it posed one of the most profound mysteries in all of science, with deep connections to both astrophysics and particle physics. Cosmic acceleration could arise from the repulsive gravity of dark energy---for example, the quantum energy of the vacuum---or it may signal that general relativity (GR) breaks down on cosmological scales and must be replaced. We review the present observational evidence for cosmic acceleration and what it has revealed about dark energy, discuss the various theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain acceleration, and describe the key observational probes that will shed light on this enigma in the coming years.},

title = {A Concise Reference to (Projected) S{\'e}rsic R1/n Quantities, Including Concentration, Profile Slopes, Petrosian Indices, and Kron Magnitudes},
abstract = {Given the growing use of S{\'e}rsic's (1963, 1968) R1/n model for describing the stellar distributions in galaxies, and the lack of any single reference that provides the various associated mathematical expressions, we have endeavoured to compile such a resource here. We present the standard intensity profile, and its various guises such as the luminosity, surface-brightness, and aperture-magnitude profile. Expressions to transform the effective surface brightness into the mean effective and central surface brightness are also given, as is the expression to transform between effective radii and exponential scale-lengths. We additionally provide expressions for deriving the `concentration' of an R1/n profile, and two useful equations for the logarithmic slope of the light-profile are given. Petrosian radii and fluxes are also derived for a range of S{\'e}rsic profiles and compared with the effective radii and total flux. Similarly, expressions to obtain Kron radii and fluxes are presented as a function of the S{\'e}rsic index n and the number of effective radii sampled. Illustrative figures are provided throughout. Finally, the core-S{\'e}rsic model, consisting of an inner power-law and an outer S{\'e}rsic function, is presented.},

title = {Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results},
abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature and polarization maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the first five years of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sky survey. The new maps are consistent with previous maps and are more sensitive. The five-year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude that W-band polarization data is not yet suitable for cosmological studies, but we suggest directions for further study. We do find that Ka-band data is suitable for use; in conjunction with the additional years of data, the addition of Ka band to the previously used Q- and V-band channels significantly reduces the uncertainty in the optical depth parameter, . Further scientific results from the five-year data analysis are presented in six companion papers and are summarized in Section 7 of this paper. With the five-year WMAP data, we detect no convincing deviations from the minimal six-parameter ΛCDM model: a flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant, with adiabatic and nearly scale-invariant Gaussian fluctuations. Using WMAP data combined with measurements of Type Ia supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the galaxy distribution, we find (68% CL uncertainties): Ω b h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 --0.00059, Ω c h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013,  = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these we derive 8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc--1, Ω b = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Ω c = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Ω m h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 --0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. The new limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.22(95%CL), while the evidence for a running spectral index is insignificant, dns /dln k = --0.028 $\pm$ 0.020 (68% CL). We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) dark energy equation of state and the spatial curvature of the universe: --0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and --0.0179 < Ω k < 0.0081(95%CL). The number of relativistic degrees of freedom, expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is found to be N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68% CL), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Models with N eff = 0 are disfavored at >99.5% confidence. Finally, new limits on physically motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are --9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and --151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

abstract = {We study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size and internal structure for a complete sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that low-redshift galaxies divide into two distinct families at a stellar mass of 3 × 1010 Msolar. Lower-mass galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low concentrations typical of discs. Their star formation histories are more strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion σ(lnR50) ~ 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as μ*~M0.54*, suggesting that the stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above 3 × 1010 Msolar, there is a rapidly increasing fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution remains lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing mass and the median stellar mass surface density is approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in massive galaxies after they have assembled.},

Thirty-eight of these galaxies form a complete, blue magnitude-limited sample. From the major-axis observations, global CO fluxes, radial distributions, diameters, and measures of asymmetry are determined. Thirty-four of these galaxies have been detected in at least one position, and 25 have been detected in three or more positions. In most of these galaxies, the distribution of CO emission is centrally peaked. However, there is one Sb galaxy with a central molecular depression, and one barred galaxy with a possible molecular bar. Two other galaxies exhibit CO asymmetries which may be the result of an ISM-ICM interaction.},

title = {An Empirical Test and Calibration of H II Region Diagnostics},
abstract = {We present spectrophotometry in the 3600-9700 {\AA} region for a sample of 39 H II regions in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, for which independent information is available on the spectral types and effective temperatures of the ionizing stars. The spectra have been used to evaluate nebular diagnostics of stellar temperature, metal abundance, and ionization parameter, and to compare the observed behavior of the line indices with predictions of nebular photoionization models. We observe a strong degeneracy between forbidden-line sequences produced by changes in stellar Teff and metal abundance, which severely complicates the application of many forbidden-line diagnostics to extragalactic H II regions. Our data confirm however that the Edmunds {\&} Pagel [O II]+[O III] abundance index and the V{\'\i}lchez {\&} Pagel η' index provide more robust diagnostics of metal abundance and stellar effective temperature, respectively. A comparison of the fractional helium ionization of the H II regions with stellar temperature confirms the reliability of the spectral type versus Teff calibration for the relevant temperature range Teff<=38,000 K. We use empirical relations between the nebular hardness indices and Teff to reinvestigate the case for systematic variations in the stellar effective temperatures and the upper initial mass functions of massive stars in extragalactic H II regions. The data are consistent with a significant softening of the ionizing spectra (consistent with cooler stellar temperatures) with increasing metal abundance, especially for Z<=Zsolar. However, unresolved degeneracies between Z and Teff still complicate the interpretation of this result.},

title = {Is AGN feedback necessary to form red elliptical galaxies?},
abstract = {We have used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-2 to simulate the formation of an elliptical galaxy in a group-size cosmological dark matter halo with mass Mhalo ~= 3 × 1012h-1Msolar at z = 0. The use of a stellar population synthesis model has allowed us to compute magnitudes, colours and surface brightness profiles. We have included a model to follow the growth of a central black hole and we have compared the results of simulations with and without feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We have studied the interplay between cold gas accretion and merging in the development of galactic morphologies, the link between colour and morphology evolution, the effect of AGN feedback on the photometry of early-type galaxies, the redshift evolution in the properties of quasar hosts, and the impact of AGN winds on the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We have found that the early phases of galaxy formation are driven by the accretion of cold filamentary flows, which form a disc galaxy at the centre of the dark matter halo. Disc star formation rates in this mode of galaxy growth are about as high as the peak star formation rates attained at a later epoch in galaxy mergers. When the dark matter halo is sufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, the gas in the filaments is heated to the virial temperature, cold accretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline. Mergers transform the spiral galaxy into an elliptical one, but they also reactivate star formation by bringing gas into the galaxy. Without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, the galaxy ends up with blue colours, which are atypical for its elliptical morphology. We have demonstrated that AGN feedback can solve this problem even with a fairly low heating efficiency. Our simulations support a picture where AGN feedback is important for quenching star formation in the remnant of wet mergers and for moving them to the red sequence. This picture is consistent with recent observational results, which suggest that AGN hosts are galaxies in migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence on the colour-magnitude diagram. However, we have also seen a transition in the properties of AGN hosts from blue and star forming at z ~ 2 to mainly red and dead at z ~ 0. Ongoing merging is the primary but not the only triggering mechanism for luminous AGN activity. Quenching by AGN is only effective after the cold filaments have dried out, since otherwise the galaxy is constantly replenished with gas. AGN feedback also contributes to raising the entropy of the hot IGM by removing low-entropy tails vulnerable to developing cooling flows. We have also demonstrated that AGN winds are potentially important for the metal enrichment of the IGM a high redshift.},

title = {GRAPE-SPH chemodynamical simulation of elliptical galaxies - II. Scaling relations and the fundamental plane},
abstract = {We simulate the formation and chemodynamical evolution of 128 elliptical galaxies using a GRAPE-SPH code that includes various physical processes that are associated with the formation of stellar systems: radiative cooling, star formation, feedback from Type II and Ia supernovae and stellar winds, and chemical enrichment. We find that the star formation time-scale controls when and where stars form in the contracting gas cloud, determines the effective radius at given mass, and is constrained by observation to be 10 times longer than the local dynamical time-scale. We succeed in reproducing the observed global scaling relations under our cold dark matter based scenario, e.g. the Faber-Jackson relation, the Kormendy relation and the fundamental plane. An intrinsic scatter exists along the fundamental plane, and the origin of this scatter lies in differences in merging history. Galaxies that undergo major merger events tend to have larger effective radii and fainter surface brightnesses, which result in larger masses, smaller surface brightnesses and larger mass-to-light ratios. We can also reproduce the observed colour-magnitude and mass-metallicity relations, although the scatter is larger than observed. The scatter arises because feedback is not very effective and star formation does not terminate completely in our simulations. ~25 per cent of accreted baryons are blown away in the simulations, independent of the assumed star formation time-scale and initial mass function. Most heavy elements end up locked into stars in the galaxy. The ejected metal fraction depends only on the star formation time-scale, and is ~2 per cent even to rapid star formation.},

title = {Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Cosmological Interpretation},
abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter Λ cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Ω b h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 --0.00059, Ω c h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013,  = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive 8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc--1, Ω b = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Ω c = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Ω m h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 --0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: --0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and --0.0179 < Ω k < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as --0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than --5fdg9 < α < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of {\Sigma}m ν < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are --9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and --151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

title = {The Central Structure of Elliptical Galaxies and the Stellar-Dynamical Search for Supermassive Black Holes},
abstract = {Elliptical galaxies are divided into two types: galaxies with steep profiles that show no breaks in slope or that have extra light at small radii compared to a S{\'e}rsic function fit and galaxies that show a break from steep outer profiles to shallow inner profiles. These cuspy cores are important because they are a sign of undiscovered physical processes. Profiles with extra light near the center resemble predictions of starburst remnants formed in dissipative mergers. There is growing evidence for a dichotomy between (1) normal- and low-luminosity Es that rotate rapidly, that are nearly isotropic, oblate-spheroidal, and substantially flattened, that have disky-distorted isophotes, and that are coreless, and (2) giant Es that are essentially nonrotating, that are anisotropic, modestly triaxial, and not very flattened, that are boxy-distorted, and that have cuspy cores. Black hole (BH) search: Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations confirm ground-based BH detections and show that mass measurements are remarkably robust. Detection of large proper motions near the Galactic center make it one of the best BH cases. Demographic results include the discovery of enough BH mass to account for quasar energetics and strong evidence that BH mass correlates with bulge luminosity. M 31 nucleus: New CFHT spectroscopy supports Tremaine's model that both nuclei are part of an eccentric disk of stars orbiting the BH. The BH is offset from the center of mass, confirming that mbh >= 3 × 10^7 Msun.},

We strongly confirm two dichotomies: (1) Elliptical galaxies from cDs to M32 form a tight sequence in Fundamental Plane parameter space that is almost perpendicular to the sequence of spheroidal galaxies from NGC 205 to Draco. This is consistent with our understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for Es and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. (2) Ellipticals come in two varieties: e.g., our 10 brightest Es have cuspy cores; our 17 fainter Es do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in coreless Es. All have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of the outer Sersic profile. We suggest that extra light is made by starbursts in dissipational (wet) mergers, as in numerical simulations. Three other new aspects also point to an explanation of how the E-E dichotomy formed: extra light Es were made in wet mergers while core Es were made in dry mergers. We confirm that core Es do and extra light Es generally do not contain X-ray gas. This suggests why the E-E dichotomy arose. Only core Es and their progenitors are massive enough to retain hot gas that can make dry mergers dry and protect old star populations from late star formation.},

title = {Improved Cosmological Constraints from New, Old, and Combined Supernova Data Sets},
abstract = {We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new data set of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe, and new analysis procedures to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This ``Union'' compilation of 414 SNe Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection cuts, includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey and ESSENCE Survey, the older data sets, as well as the recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A single, consistent, and blind analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples, and a new procedure is implemented that consistently weights the heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest results from this Union compilation and discuss the cosmological constraints from this new compilation and its combination with other cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain from supernovae on the dark energy density is ΩΛ=0.713+0.027-0.029(stat)+0.036-0.039(sys), for a flat, ΛCDM universe. Assuming a constant equation of state parameter, w, the combined constraints from SNe, BAO, and CMB give w=-0.969+0.059-0.063(stat)+0.063-0.066(sys). While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weak constraints on a w that varies with redshift. In particular, the current SN data do not yet significantly constrain w at z>1. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these resulting cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available.},

title = {The Star Formation Efficiency in Nearby Galaxies: Measuring where Gas Forms Stars Effectively},
abstract = {We measure the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate (SFR) per unit of gas, in 23 nearby galaxies and compare it with expectations from proposed star formation laws and thresholds. We use H I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and derive H2 maps of CO measured by HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We estimate the SFR by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from SINGS 3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We measure the SFE as a function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure, stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars), the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H2 alone is nearly constant at (5.25 $\pm$ 2.5) × 10 10 yr 1 (equivalent to an H2 depletion time of 1.9 × 109 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium (ISM) is mostly H I, however, the SFE decreases with increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential with scale length 0.2r 25-0.25r 25. We interpret this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud (GMC) formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure spanning from the H2-dominated to H I-dominated ISM. The radial decline in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE. We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe---phase balance in the H I, H2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback---governs the formation of GMCs from H I.},

title = {The Effect of Cluster Environment on Galaxy Evolution in the Pegasus I Cluster},
abstract = {We present neutral hydrogen observations of 54 galaxies in the Pegasus Cluster. The observations include single-dish H I measurements, obtained with the Arecibo telescope for all 54 galaxies in the sample, as well as H I images obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) for 10 of these. The Arecibo profiles reveal an overall H I deficiency in the cluster, with ~40% of the galaxies in the core of the cluster showing modest deficiencies of typically a factor of 2-3. The H I morphology of some galaxies shows that the H I disk is smaller than the optical disk and slightly offset from the stars. We find a correlation between H I deficiency and the ratio of the H I disk size to optical disk size. More H I-deficient galaxies have relatively smaller H I disks, a configuration that is usually attributed to an interaction between the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy and the hot intracluster medium (ICM). Such a result is surprising, since the Pegasus Cluster has a low level of X-ray emission and a low velocity dispersion. The low velocity dispersion, coupled with the lack of a dense hot ICM, indicate that ram pressure stripping should not play a significant role in this environment. In addition, two of the galaxies, NGC 7604 and NGC 7648, are morphologically peculiar. Their peculiarities indicate contradictory scenarios of what is triggering their unusual star formation. Hα imaging, along with long-slit spectroscopy of NGC 7648, reveal morphological features that point to a recent tidal interaction. On the other hand, Hα imaging of NGC 7604 reveals a strong episode of star formation concentrated into an asymmetric arc, preferentially located on one side of the galaxy. VLA H I mapping shows that H I is also highly concentrated into that region, suggestive of a ram pressure event. Our data indicate that ISM-ICM interactions may play a role in a wider variety of environments than suggested by simple ram pressure arguments.},

variable-width bins, which is much more robust.  They are only looking
for evolution {\em within\/} their sample, although they do note that
if they compare to Loveday, they are not in agreement: they want
either higher $\phi^{\ast}$ or steeper faint-end slope.  The claim
that there is strong evidence for evolution in the blue galaxies is
slightly suspect, because (a) at different redshifts the survey probes
a different range of absolute magnitudes, (b) if all the points from
different redshift bins are superimposed, the evolution does not look
all that strong, (c) the plots are tiny and on log-log scales, and (d)
we know that galaxies lie in sheets and this affects the statistics
one should apply to the sample.  However, Lilly is cautious enough
that I am sure that the evidence for evolution is significant, at

title = {K-band Properties of Galaxy Clusters and Groups: Brightest Cluster Galaxies and Intracluster Light},
abstract = {We investigate the near-infrared K-band properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a sample of 93 X-ray galaxy clusters and groups, using data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Our cluster sample spans a factor of 70 in mass, making it sensitive to any cluster mass-related trends. We derive the cumulative radial distribution for the BCGs in the ensemble and find that 70% of the BCGs are centered in the cluster to within 5% of the virial radius r200; this quantifies earlier findings that BCG position coincides with the cluster center as defined by the X-ray emission peak. We study the correlations between the luminosity of the BCGs (Lb) and the mass and the luminosity of the host clusters, finding that BCGs in more massive clusters are more luminous than their counterparts in less massive systems and that the BCGs become less important in the overall cluster light (L200) as cluster mass increases. By examining a large sample of optically selected groups, we find that these correlations hold for galactic systems less massive than our clusters (<3×1013 Msolar). From the differences between luminosity functions in high- and low-mass clusters, we argue that BCGs grow in luminosity mainly by merging with other luminous galaxies as the host clusters grow hierarchically; the decreasing BCG luminosity fraction (Lb/L200) with cluster mass indicates that the rate of luminosity growth in BCGs is slow compared to the rate at which clusters acquire galaxy light from the field or other merging clusters. Utilizing the observed correlation between the cluster luminosity and mass and a merger tree model for cluster formation, we estimate that the amount of intracluster light (ICL) increases with cluster mass; our calculations suggest that in 1015 Msolar clusters more than 50% of total stellar mass is in ICL, making the role of ICL very important in the evolution and thermodynamic history of clusters. The cluster baryon fraction accounting for the ICL is in good agreement with the value derived from cosmic microwave background observations. The inclusion of ICL reduces the discrepancy between the observed cluster cold baryon fraction and that found in hydrodynamical simulations. Based on the observed iron abundance in the intracluster medium, we find that the ICL predicted by our model, together with the observed galaxy light, match the iron mass-to-light ratio expected from simple stellar population models, provided that the Salpeter initial mass function is adopted. The ICL also makes it easier to produce the ``iron excess'' found in the central regions of cool-core clusters.},

Unanticipated recent X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM indicate much less cooling than previously expected. Consequently, many long-held assumptions must be reexamined or discarded and new approaches must be explored. Chief among these are the role of heating by active galactic nuclei, the influence of radio lobes on the hot gas, details of the cooling process, possible relation between the hot and colder gas in elliptical galaxies, and the complexities of stellar enrichment of the hot gas.},

title = {Another forbidden solar oxygen abundance: the [O I] 5577 {\AA} line},
abstract = {Context: Recent works with improved model atmospheres, line formation, atomic and molecular data, and detailed treatment of blends have resulted in a significant downward revision of the solar oxygen abundance. Aims: Considering the importance of the Sun as an astrophysical standard and the current conflict of standard solar models using the new solar abundances with helioseismological observations we have performed a new study of the solar oxygen abundance based on the forbidden [O I] line at 5577.34 {\AA}, not previously considered. Methods: High-resolution (R > 500 000), high signal-to-noise (S/N > 1000) solar spectra of the [O I] 5577.34 {\AA} line have been analyzed employing both three-dimensional (3D) and a variety of 1D (spatially and temporally averaged 3D, Holweger {\&} M{\"u}ller, MARCS and Kurucz models with and without convective overshooting) model atmospheres. Results: The oxygen abundance obtained from the [O I] 5577.3 {\AA} forbidden line is almost insensitive to the input model atmosphere and has a mean value of log ɛO = 8.71 $\pm$ 0.02 (σ from using the different model atmospheres). The total error (0.07 dex) is dominated by uncertainties in the log gf value (0.03 dex), apparent line variation (0.04 dex) and uncertainties in the continuum and line positions (0.05 dex). Conclusions: The oxygen abundance derived here is close to the 3D-based estimates from the two other [O I] lines at 6300 and 6363 {\AA}, the permitted O I lines and vibrational and rotational OH transitions in the infrared. Our study thus supports a low solar oxygen abundance (log ɛO ≈ 8.7), independent of the adopted model atmosphere.},

title = {Peculiarities and populations in elliptical galaxies. I. An old question revisited},
abstract = {Morphological peculiarities, as defined from isophote asymmetries and number of detected shells, jets or similar features, have been estimated in a sample of 117 E classified galaxies, and qualified by an ad hoc Σ2 index. The overall frequency of ``peculiar'' objects (Pec subsample) is 32.5%. It decreases with the cosmic density of the environment, being minimal for the Virgo cluster, the densest environment in the sampled volume. This environmental effect is stronger for galaxies with relatively large Σ2. The Pec subsample objects are compared with ``normal'' objects (Nop subsample) as regards their basic properties. Firstly, they systematically deviate from the Fundamental Plane and the Faber-Jackson relation derived for the Nop subsample, being too bright for their mass. Secondly, the dust content of galaxies, as estimated from IRAS fluxes, are similar in both subsamples. Third, the same is true of the frequency of Kinematically Distinct cores (KDC), suggesting that KDC and morphological peculiarities do not result from the same events in the history of E-galaxies. Using the Nop sample alone, we obtain very tight reference relations between stellar population indicators (U-B, B-V, B-R, V-I, Mg2, Hβ, <Fe>, Mgb) and the central velocity dispersion σ0. The discussion of the residuals of these relations allows us to classify the Pec galaxies in two families i.e. the YP or NGC 2865 family, and the NP or NGC 3923 one. Galaxies in the first group show consistent evidence for a younger stellar population mixed with the old one, in agreement with classical results (Schweizer et al. \cite{Schweizer1990}; Schweizer {\&} Seitzer \cite{Schweizer1992}). The second group, however, has ``normal``, or reddish, populations. It is remarkable that a fraction (circa 40%) of morphologically perturbed objects do not display any signature of a young population, either because the event responsible for the pecularity is too ancient, or because it did not produce significant star formation (or eventually that the young sub-population has high metallicity). A preliminary attempt is made to interpret the populations of Pec objects by combining a young Single Stellar Population with a Nop galaxy, with only limited success, perhaps largely due to uncertainties in the SSP indices used. Based in part on observations collected at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence.

title = {Constraining anisotropic baryon oscillations},
abstract = {We present an analysis of anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillations and elucidate how a mis-estimation of the cosmology, which leads to incorrect values of the angular diameter distance, dA, and Hubble parameter, H, manifest themselves in changes to the monopole and quadrupole power spectrum of biased tracers of the density field. Previous work has focused on the monopole power spectrum, and shown that the isotropic dilation combination dA2H-1 is robustly constrained by an overall shift in the scale of the baryon feature. We extend this by demonstrating that the quadrupole power spectrum is sensitive to an anisotropic warping mode dAH, allowing one to break the degeneracy between dA and H. We describe a method for measuring this warping, explicitly marginalizing over the form of redshift-space distortions. We verify this method on N-body simulations and estimate that dAH can be measured with a fractional accuracy of (3/V)% where the survey volume is estimated in h-3Gpc3.},

title = {Reconstructing baryon oscillations: A Lagrangian theory perspective},
abstract = {Recently Eisenstein and collaborators introduced a method to ``reconstruct'' the linear power spectrum from a nonlinearly evolved galaxy distribution in order to improve precision in measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. We reformulate this method within the Lagrangian picture of structure formation, to better understand what such a method does, and what the resulting power spectra are. We show that reconstruction does not reproduce the linear density field, at second order. We however show that it does reduce the damping of the oscillations due to nonlinear structure formation, explaining the improvements seen in simulations. Our results suggest that the reconstructed power spectrum is potentially better modeled as the sum of three different power spectra, each dominating over different wavelength ranges and with different nonlinear damping terms. Finally, we also show that reconstruction reduces the mode-coupling term in the power spectrum, explaining why miscalibrations of the acoustic scale are reduced when one considers the reconstructed power spectrum.},

title = {Measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey},
abstract = {We introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). BAOs are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.2. BAOs in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.35. The observed scales of the BAOs calculated from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure DV(z)  [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3. Here DA is the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives rs/DV(0.2) = 0.1980 +/- 0.0058 and rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1094 +/- 0.0033 (1 errors), with a correlation coefficient of 0.39, where rs is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the BAOs to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.812 +/- 0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) supernova data for Λ cold dark matter cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at a low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant w, then we find Ωm = 0.249 +/- 0.018 and w = -1.004 +/- 0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the cosmic microwave background.},

title = {Testing cosmological structure formation using redshift-space distortions},
abstract = {Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmological structure. In this paper, we develop and test a new statistic based on anisotropies in the measured galaxy power spectrum, which is independent of galaxy bias and matches the matter power spectrum shape on large scales. The amplitude provides a constraint on the derivative of the linear growth rate through f8(mass). This demonstrates that spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer many of the same advantages as weak lensing surveys, in that they both use galaxies as test particles to probe all matter in the Universe. They are complementary as redshift-space distortions probe non-relativistic velocities and therefore the temporal metric perturbations, while weak lensing tests the sum of the temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The degree to which our estimator can be pushed into the non-linear regime is considered and we show that a simple Gaussian damping model, similar to that previously used to model the behaviour of the power spectrum on very small scales, can also model the quasi-linear behaviour of our estimator. This enhances the information that can be extracted from surveys for Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) models.},

title = {Correlations between UBV colors and fine structure in E and S0 galaxies - A first attempt at dating ancient merger events},
abstract = {New high-quality UBV colors of E and S0 galaxies compiled in the RC3 are analyzed, and correlations between them and the fine-structure index Sigma are explored. The color residuals Delta(U-B)e,0, Delta(B-V)e,0, and Delta(U-V)e,0 (where e refers to the effective or half-light aperture) correlate with Sigma for 35 E and 34 S0 galaxies both separately and combined. Typical coefficients are -0.4 to -0.6, and the slopes of the mean relations are significant at the 2.1 sigma-4.2 sigma level. The new correlations show that the detected systematic variations are not limited to the nuclei, but occur globally in the stellar populations of E and S0 galaxies. The color residuals and previously determined line-strength residuals correlate closely, demonstrating that it is cosmic scatter that dominates the vertical scatter in the color-magnitude and line-strength-magnitude relations. It is suggested that the deviations in color and line strength from mean relations have a common physical cause which, because of the correlations with fine structure, is probably a variation in the mean age of the stellar populations.},

title = {Nonlinear Structure Formation and the Acoustic Scale},
abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of the acoustic scale in the presence of nonlinear growth and redshift distortions using 320 h-3 Gpc3 of cosmological particle-mesh simulations. Using simple fitting methods, we obtain robust measurements of the acoustic scale with scatter close to that predicted by the Fisher matrix. We detect and quantify the shift in the acoustic scale by analyzing the power spectrum: we detect at greater than 5  a decrease in the acoustic scale in the real-space matter power spectrum of 0.2% at z=1.5, growing to 0.45% at z=0.3. In redshift space, the shifts are about 25% larger: we detect a decrease of 0.25% at z=1.5 and 0.54% at z=0.3. Despite the nonzero amounts, these shifts are highly predictable numerically, and hence removable within the standard ruler analysis of clustering data. Moreover, we show that a simple density field reconstruction method substantially reduces the scatter and nonlinear shifts of the acoustic scale measurements: the shifts are reduced to less than 0.1% at z=0.3-1.5, even in the presence of nonnegligible shot noise. Finally, we show that the ratio of the cosmological distance to the sound horizon that would be inferred from these fits is robust to variations in the parameterization of the fitting method and reasonable differences in the template cosmology.},

Scientists from around the world have applied its orders-of-magnitude gain in imaging and spectroscopic capability to a wide array of topics in extragalactic research. Spitzer studies have found massive galaxies at redshifts greater than 6, resolved the cosmic background at 200 μm > λ > 20 μm into the dusty infrared-luminous galaxies that comprise it, directly detected dust-enshrouded star formation, and measured the star formation history of the universe to z > 3. In this review we examine a small fraction of the extragalactic studies from Spitzer that have been conducted in its first three years of operations.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
title = {Tests of Statistical Methods for Estimating Galaxy Luminosity Function and Applications to the Hubble Deep Field},
abstract = {We study statistical methods for the estimation of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies. We focus on four nonparametric estimators: the 1/Vmax estimator, the stepwise maximum-likelihood estimator, Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator, and the improved Lynden-Bell estimator. The performance of the 1/Vmax estimator has recently been questioned, especially for the faint-end estimation of the LF. We improve these estimators for studies of the distant universe, and examine their performances for various classes of functional forms by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply these estimation methods to the mock Two-Degree Field (2dF) redshift survey catalog prepared by Cole et al. We find that the 1/Vmax estimator yields a completely unbiased result if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against clusters or voids. This is consistent with the well-known results, and we do not confirm the bias trend of 1/Vmax claimed by Willmer in the case of a homogeneous sample. We also find that the other three maximum-likelihood type estimators are quite robust and give consistent results with each other. In practice, we recommend Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator for two reasons: (1) it simultaneously provides the shape and normalization of the LF; and (2) it is the fastest among these four estimators, because of its algorithmic simplicity. We then analyze the photometric redshift data of the Hubble Deep Field prepared by Fern{\'a}ndez-Soto et al. using the above four methods. We also derive the luminosity density, ρL, at the B and I bands. Our B-band estimation is roughly consistent with that of Sawicki, Lin, {\&} Yee, but it is a few times lower at 2.0<z<3.0. The evolution of ρL(I) is found to be less prominent.},

A sequence of 'anemic spirals', which occur most frequently in rich clusters, is found to have characteristics that are intermediate between those of vigorous gas-rich normal spirals and gas-poor systems of type S0. The differences between normal spirals (Sa-Sb-Sc), anemic spirals (Aa-Ab-Ac), and lenticulars (S0a-S0b-S0c) are tentatively interpreted in terms of the influence of environment on the evolution of flattened galaxies.},

   I like their questioning of authority and established wisdom, and
   am impressed by the model fits, but question the main premise,
   concerning the question

   A) are ellipticals and S0 galaxies intrinsically and
   observationally distinguishable galaxy types at 0 < z < 1?

   i) I believe the answer is ``yes''. I believe you and others, as
   Dressler, can assure us that the luminosity function of
   ellipticals at z = 1 is quite close to what it is today, after
   taking account of passive evolution. And I gather van Dokkum and
   Franx would agree that in this case the bulk of stars in the
   elliptical population have to have formed at redshifts well above
   unity.

   If, as van Dokkum and Franx suggest, the answer to (A) ``no'',
   the big question in my mind is

   B) is it reasonable to think that a gigayear after star formation
   ceased in a cluster spiral, I presume because the gas was
   stripped away, the spiral galaxy could have transformed into an
   early-type galaxy with the shape familiarly known as an
   elliptical morphological type?

   If, as I suspect, the answer to (B) is ``no'', then I think we have
   accept interpretation (i) for ellipticals and revise question (A)
   to

   A') is it reasonable to assume many spirals cluster transform
   into S0s as the spirals lose their gas and their more massive
   stars fade away?

   van Dokkum and Franx note that this scenario could make S0 star
   populations younger than E's, in apparent contradiction of quite
   similar colour-magnitude relations (CMR). But I see (from
   reading during lunch just finished) that in MS1054 (ApJ 541, 85,
   2000) van Dokkum show in Fig. 8 that early-type spirals in MS1054
   are quite close to the early-type CMR, and I would think could
   easily fit it after ageing for a few Gyr. Other spirals are well
   off the early-type CMR, and maybe will remain so, as anemic
   spirals. So my answer to (a') is ``yes''."

abstract = {We present observations of the dust and atomic gas phase in seven dwarf irregular galaxies of the M81 group from the Spitzer SINGS and VLA THINGS surveys. The Spitzer observations provide a first glimpse of the nature of the nonatomic ISM in these metal-poor (Z~0.1 Zsolar), quiescent (SFR~0.001-0.1 Msolar yr-1) dwarf galaxies. Most detected dust emission is restricted to H I column densities >1×1021 cm-2, and almost all regions of high H I column density (>2.5×1021 cm-2) have associated dust emission. Spitzer spectroscopy of two regions in the brightest galaxies (IC 2574 and Holmberg II) show distinctly different spectral shapes and aromatic features, although the galaxies have comparable gas-phase metallicities. This result emphasizes that the strength of the aromatic features is not a simple linear function of metallicity. We estimate dust masses of ~104-106 Msolar for the M81 dwarf galaxies, resulting in an average dust-to-gas ratio (Mdust/MHI) of ~3×10-4 (1.5×10-3 if only the H I that is associated with dust emission is considered); this is an order of magnitude lower than the typical value derived for the SINGS spirals. The dwarf galaxies are underluminous per unit star formation rate at 70 μm as compared to the more massive galaxies in SINGS by a factor of ~2. However, the average 70/160 μm ratio in the sample dwarf galaxies is higher than what is found in the other galaxies of the SINGS sample. This can be explained by a combination of a lower dust content in conjunction with a higher dust temperature in the dwarfs.},

abstract = {We present "The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS)," a high spectral (<=5.2 km s 1) and spatial (~6'') resolution survey of H I emission in 34 nearby galaxies obtained using the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA). The overarching scientific goal of THINGS is to investigate fundamental characteristics of the interstellar medium (ISM) related to galaxy morphology, star formation, and mass distribution across the Hubble sequence. Unique characteristics of the THINGS database are the homogeneous sensitivity as well as spatial and velocity resolution of the H I data, which is at the limit of what can be achieved with the VLA for a significant number of galaxies. A sample of 34 objects at distances 2 lsim D lsim 15 Mpc (resulting in linear resolutions of ~100 to 500 pc) are targeted in THINGS, covering a wide range of star formation rates (~10 3 to 6 M sun yr 1), total H I masses M HI (0.01 to 14 × 109 M sun), absolute luminosities M B ( 11.5 to 21.7 mag), and metallicities (7.5 to 9.2 in units of 12+log[O/H]). We describe the setup of the VLA observations, the data reduction procedures, and the creation of the final THINGS data products. We present an atlas of the integrated H I maps, the velocity fields, the second moment (velocity dispersion) maps and individual channel maps of each THINGS galaxy. The THINGS data products are made publicly available through a dedicated webpage. Accompanying THINGS papers (in this issue of the Astronomical Journal) address issues such as the small-scale structure of the ISM, the (dark) matter distribution in THINGS galaxies, and the processes leading to star formation.},

@ARTICLE{ wong02a,

title = {The Relationship between Gas Content and Star Formation in Molecule-rich Spiral Galaxies},
abstract = {We investigate the relationship between H I, H2, and the star formation rate (SFR) using azimuthally averaged data for seven CO-bright spiral galaxies. Contrary to some earlier studies based on global fluxes, we find that ΣSFR exhibits a much stronger correlation with ΣH2 than with ΣHI, as ΣHI saturates at a value of ~ 10 Msolar pc-2 or even declines for large ΣSFR. Hence, the good correlation between ΣSFR and the total (H I+H2) gas surface density Σgas is driven by the molecular component in these galaxies, with the observed relation between ΣSFR and ΣH2 following a Schmidt-type law of index nmol~0.8 if a uniform extinction correction is applied or nmol~1.4 for a radially varying correction dependent on gas density. The corresponding Schmidt law indices for Σgas versus ΣSFR are 1.1 and 1.7 for the two extinction models, in rough agreement with previous studies of the disk-averaged star formation law. An alternative to the Schmidt law, in which the gas depletion timescale is proportional to the orbital timescale, is also consistent with the data if radially varying extinction corrections are applied. We find no clear evidence for a link between the gravitational instability parameter for the gas disk (Qg) and the SFR, and we suggest that Qg be considered a measure of the gas fraction. This implies that for a state of marginal gravitational stability to exist in galaxies with low gas fractions, it must be enforced by the stellar component. In regions where we have both H I and CO measurements, the ratio of H I to H2 surface density scales with radius as roughly R1.5, and we suggest that the balance between H I and H2 is determined primarily by the midplane interstellar pressure. These results favor a ``law'' of star formation in quiescent disks in which the ambient pressure and metallicity control the formation of molecular clouds from H I, with star formation then occurring at a roughly constant rate per unit H2 mass.},

title = {E+A Galaxies with Blue Cores: Active Galaxies in Transition},
abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS images reveal blue cores in four E+A, or post-starburst, galaxies. Follow-up spectroscopy shows that these cores have LINER spectra. The existence of LINERs, consistent with those in many elliptical galaxies, is yet one more piece of evidence that these postmerger, post-starburst, bulge-dominated galaxies will evolve into normal elliptical galaxies. More interestingly, if LINERs are powered by low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), their presence in these E+A's suggests that any rapid growth phase of the central black hole ended in rough concert with the cessation of star formation. This result emphasizes the importance of E+A's for exploring how the evolution of black holes and AGNs may be tied to that of galactic bulges.},

title = {Morphological Transformation from Galaxy Harassment},
abstract = {Galaxy morphologies in clusters have undergone a remarkable transition over the past several billion yr. Distant clusters at z ~ 0.4 are filled with small spiral galaxies, many of which are disturbed and show evidence of multiple bursts of star formation. This population is absent from nearby clusters, where spheroidals comprise the faint end of the luminosity function. Our numerical simulations follow the evolution of disk galaxies in a rich cluster resulting from encounters with brighter galaxies and the cluster's tidal field, or "galaxy harassment." After a bursting transient phase, they undergo a complete morphological transformation from "disks" to "spheroidals." We examine the remnants and find support for our theory in detailed comparisons of the photometry and kinematics of the spheroidal galaxies in clusters. Our model naturally accounts for the intermediate-age stellar population seen in these spheroidals, as well as for the trend in the dwarf-to-giant ratio with cluster richness. The final shapes are typically prolate and are flattened primarily by velocity anisotropy. Their mass-to-light ratios are in the range 3-8, in good agreement with observations.},

title = {Multicomponent decompositions for a sample of S0 galaxies},
abstract = {We have estimated the bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios in the Ks band for a sample of 24 S0, S0/a and Sa galaxies by applying a two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition method. For the disc an exponential function is used, the bulges are fitted by a S{\'e}rsic R1/n function and the bars and ovals are described either by a S{\'e}rsic or a Ferrers function. In order to avoid non-physical solutions, preliminary characterization of the structural components is made by inspecting the radial profiles of the orientation parameters and the low azimuthal wavenumber Fourier amplitudes and phases. In order to identify also the inner structures, unsharp masks were created: previously undetected inner spiral arms were found in NGC 1415 and marginally in NGC 3941. Most importantly, we found that S0s have a mean <B/T>K ratio of 0.24 +/- 0.11, which is significantly smaller than the mean <B/T>R= 0.6 generally reported in the literature. Also, the surface brightness profiles of the bulges in S0s were found to be more exponential-like than generally assumed, the mean shape parameter of the bulge being <n>= 2.1 +/- 0.7. We did not find examples of barred S0s lacking the disc component, but we found some galaxies (NGC 718, 1452 and 4608) having a non-exponential disc in the bar region. To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to apply a multicomponent decomposition method for a moderately sized sample of early-type disc galaxies.},

title = {Can Early-Type Galaxies Evolve from the Fading of the Disks of Late-Type Galaxies?},
abstract = {We examine whether early-type galaxies in clusters may have evolved from later types by the fading of their disks (e.g., as a result of ram pressure stripping or strangulation) or by enhancement of the bulge luminosity (e.g., due to tidal interactions and mergers). For this purpose, we compare the bulge and disk luminosities of early- and late-type galaxies and of galaxies at different radial distances from the cluster center. We find that in order for early-type galaxies, including S0, to have evolved from late-type galaxies, their bulge luminosities must have been physically enhanced. Disk-fading models cannot explain the differences observed. We then show that galaxy bulges are systematically brighter at small projected distances from the cluster center, while disk luminosities are uncorrelated with clustercentric distance. Our results suggest that bulge enhancement, not disk fading, distinguishes early- from late-type galaxies and is thus at least partially responsible for the morphology-environment relation of bright cluster galaxies.},

title = {Most Real Bars are Not Made by the Bar Instability},
abstract = {Having once thought that we understood how some galaxies were barred and had difficulty accounting for the absence of bars in others, it now seems that we have the opposite problem. Most real galaxies have centres dense enough to inhibit bar formation, even if they have massive discs. This is also true for barred galaxies, which therefore could not have acquired their bars as a result of a self-excited, global instability. There is a hint from the morphology of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Fields that the growth of bars might be a slow or secular process. Here I discuss possible mechanisms that could form bars long after the disc is assembled.},

title = {The Distribution of Bar and Spiral Arm Strengths in Disk Galaxies},
abstract = {The distribution of bar strengths in disk galaxies is a fundamental property of the galaxy population that has only begun to be explored. We have applied the bar-spiral separation method of Buta and coworkers to derive the distribution of maximum relative gravitational bar torques, Qb, for 147 spiral galaxies in the statistically well-defined Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey (OSUBGS) sample. Our goal is to examine the properties of bars as independently as possible of their associated spirals. We find that the distribution of bar strength declines smoothly with increasing Qb, with more than 40% of the sample having Qb<=0.1. In the context of recurrent bar formation, this suggests that strongly barred states are relatively short-lived compared to weakly barred or nonbarred states. We do not find compelling evidence for a bimodal distribution of bar strengths. Instead, the distribution is fairly smooth in the range 0.0<=Qb<0.8. Our analysis also provides a first look at spiral strengths Qs in the OSUBGS sample, based on the same torque indicator. We are able to verify a possible weak correlation between Qs and Qb, in the sense that galaxies with the strongest bars tend to also have strong spirals.},
