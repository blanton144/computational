You {\it must} label all axes of all plots, including giving the {\it
  units}!!

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exercise 5.3 in Newman. In addition, use the NumPy
    implementation of the error function {\tt erf} (which this is
    very close to) to check your answer. Note that the NumPy (and
    other library's) implementation of {\tt erf} uses a very accurate
    fitting formula, not an explicit integration, which makes it very
    fast.
  \item Exercise 5.10 in Newman. 
  \item Exercise 5.12 in Newman. 
\end{enumerate}
